# Parallelized Computing on HPC Clusters with JAX on GPUs
A rep. containing some tutorials about parallel computing on a High-Performance Cluster. Especially for JAX-based parallelized computing on multiple GPUs.

Most of the useful information is avaliable on the wiki of the repo. The tutorials on this repo are based on the assumption that one is using a linux based HPC cluster that contains GPU nodes with Nvidia CUDA compatible graphic cards. 

Please check out the repo wiki with the tutorials https://github.com/egeggn/Parallelized_Computing_on_HPC/wiki
